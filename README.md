A collection of generative music systems for [Generative.fm](https://generative.fm).

Documentation for installing and running the systems locally will be available at a later time.

## Regarding code quality (or lack thereof)

Most of the systems within this repository were written during a period where I'd set an aggressive pace for myself to create new systems regularly and experiment. As a result, code quality suffered. Unfortunately, this means the code may be hard to understand, and I don't consider it to be a good example of how I typically build software. Someday, I'd love to improve these systems so they're easier for you to read.

You've been warned!
